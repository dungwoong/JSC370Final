# JSC370Final
Final Project JSC370

I will be investigating Cars, and used car listings in GTA.

Ideally, I would scrape the data myself from KijijiAutos, but I am unable to find a
quick solution to do so, so I will use 2019 data to stand in for that.

I then took some market price data for the cars from MotorTrend.com.

It's important to note that the market price data was scraped in 2023, whereas the listing
data was scraped in 2019, so the cars in the listings may have
depreciated in price since then.
